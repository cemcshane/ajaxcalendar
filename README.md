# CSE330
Student ID: 464850, Link: http://ec2-3-19-70-167.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/~cemcshane/module5/group/calendar.php  Logging in:  You can log in with username: cemcshane and password: password or create an account,  Creative portion: I created a logout button (self explanatory), a delete user button (removes user and all their events from database and they can no longer log in), and a line at the top of the page that greets the user "Hello, (username)". Additionally, I created a button that creates a text file of all the events for the month the user is currently viewing that they can then download.  Finally, I created a button that displays a countdown timer to whatever event they'd like to see a countdown to.
